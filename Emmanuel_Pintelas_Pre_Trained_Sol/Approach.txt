"""Our approach has the following main key characteristics:
         - pre-trained Seresnet152d base model with size input 224x224
         - Meta-Train dataset is utilized
         - We apply "Circular Augmentations" during Meta-Train.
         - We apply a new training scheduler pipeline during Meta-Train.
         - In Meta-Test phase we utilize an ensemble of Linear-based and Distance-based ML models. 
           In this step, we use the Support-Set to extract features via the Seresnet152d baseline 
           and then feed them into the proposed ensemble ML classifier.

Our research contributions:
         - We introduce "Circular Augmentations" which is an augmentation pipeline scheduler 
           in order to improve the training of any CNN-based model
         - We introduce a new training scheduler pipeline which is an optimization validation scheduler 
           in order to improve the training of any CNN-based model.
         - We propose an ensemble of Linear-based and Distance-based ML models 
           which drastically improves the final classification performance specifically for the Any-Way-Any-Shot Learning tasks.
